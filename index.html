		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>
			We are student church bell-ringers from the University of Nottingham and Nottingham Trent University, but we
			welcome locals of university age too! Our members range from absolute beginners, to those who have been
			ringing for years.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our regular practice is every Tuesday from <time datetime="19:00">7PM</time> until
			<time datetime="20:30">8:30PM</time> at
			<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/hsWKtzxmQAwdBZ4V6">All Saints&rsquo; Church, Radford</a>. We also ring for
			Sunday Services there from <time datetime="10:00">10AM</time> until <time datetime="10:30">10:30AM</time>.
			We don&rsquo;t ring outside of University of Nottingham term time.
